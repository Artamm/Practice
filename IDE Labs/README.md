Integrated development environments module
> In accordance with the requirements described in the task create a program that reads the required data entered by user:
- Student name and surname;
- Homeworks and exam results;
- After entering the data, calculate the final points and show it to the screen in like this way (the final points was calculated by
two decimal places after comma):
- Add to a program possibility to use median instead of average for final points calculation. Then the output should look
similar to this, where only one selected Final points (Avg.) / Final points (Med.) is outputed:
- Complement the program so that it works even if the number of homework (n) is unknown from beginning, i.e. just entering
the user decides when he had already inputted all homework results. 
> This part should be realized in two ways, where
homework results are stored in:
- Simple array.
- List<T> type container.
- Add to the program the possibility that the student points for homework and exam will be randomly generated
